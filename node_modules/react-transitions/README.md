## Installation ##

## <a name="transitions"></a>Transitions
This package comes with a set of animated transitions out of the box. `ReactTransitions.Transitions`
makes a list of their names. Each name is a string to be supplied to `transition` prop of `ReactTransitions`.

Here are a few of the names for illustration:

* "move-to-left-move-from-right",
* "fade-move-from-right",
* "scale-down-move-from-right",
* "rotate-right-side-first-move-from-right"

There are some more options ready for you. Either make use of the [demo][demo] page to see the full list, or dump
the contents of `ReactTransitions.Transitions` which should always be up-to-date.

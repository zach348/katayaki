TODO
-order goals according to trending/popularity
-add aspiration count to goal show ... will need to be a total history which will
require a new db column on goal
-change buttons on rating view to abstract icons (check fontawesome)
-add offset to improve randomization of aspiration json service
-adjust borders (too thick on rating/show pages and too thin on header)
-clean up katayaki show page
